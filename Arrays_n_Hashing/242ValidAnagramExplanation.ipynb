    "I knew I needed to iterate through the s and t strings, because without checking each of the items, we cannot figure out if original letters from first string used in the second string exactly once.\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "First, I decided to check the edge case where both string's length is different.\n",
    "Second, I initialized an empty dictionary (word={}), I visited each of the letter in first string (s). I added each of the item to the dictionary as key, and their indexes as value {key(letter):value(index)}.\n",
    "Third, while checking every letter in the second string (t), I decreased the indexes of them by one.\n",
    "Lastly, I have checked if all of the values are 0, meaning if all of the items from s, are equal to the items of t.\n",
