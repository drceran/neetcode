# Hello!
Data structures and algorithms play a crucial role in software engineering and are essential for creating efficient and optimized solutions. As you gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, you'll be able to devise more efficient algorithms and utilize appropriate data structures to solve various programming problems.

# About Data Structures and Algorithms: Solutions and Explanations Repository
In this repo, I will follow the neetcode's road map (https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Starting from the first topic, and easiest problems, I will share the solutions of the problems and explanations of the code. The folder names are same with the topic names, and file names are Leetcode problem names.

This repo documents my process of data structures and algorithms studies. I hope it helps other learners as well.
